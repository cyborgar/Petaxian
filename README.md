# Petaxian

This is a small project started to scrach muliple itches

- Doing something with the Commander X16 emulator (without having to work inside the emulator)
- Writing something low level without having to write things in assembly (at least for now)
- Test a new language (Prog8) found on the X16 pages

I fairly recently saw some good demos using C64 emulator and just PETSCII graphics and then
I remebered the old Galaga game on the C64. The one using just character graphics and thought
it would be interesting to test how difficult it would be to make something similar.

This is written in Prog8, see

- https://github.com/irmen/prog8
- https://prog8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

and this is mostly a fun test project (it may never reach a finished state)

Though I have been targetting the X16 for now, I haven't done anyting that should prevent
this from working on the C64. I.e. I'm keeping the active field within the 40x25 of the C64.
